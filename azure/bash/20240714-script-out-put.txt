github actions ... build test and deploy code
github actions ... can add labels when issue is created, for example
github actions run on linux windows or macos machines called runners
github actions ... workflow is triggered ... on event ...
... workflow contains jobs ... in sequence or in parallel
... each job runs in own runner vm or container
... each job has a number of steps ...
... each step runs a script or an action which is a reusable extension
event
... triggers workflow ... defined in yaml ...
... workflows in .github/workflows folder
... event ... workflow ...
... vm runner 1 runs job 1 ... steps ... either actions or scripts ...
... jobs .. can have dependencies if desired ...

run all my code on a commit, not just when i want to run it?
