if on fedora use this command
If you use lchsh you need to type /bin/zsh to make it your default shell.
Log out and log back in again to use your new default shell.
Test that it worked with echo /bin/bash. Expected result: /bin/zsh or similar
Test with /bin/bash --version. Expected result: zsh 5.8 or similar

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

error: no server found for cluster "minikube"
error: no server found for cluster "minikube"



some services eg storage-provisioner may not be running
this is normal during cluster bring-up
this will resolve itself
minkube dashboard shows status of clusters
* Profile "minikube" not found. Run "minikube profile list" to view all profiles.
  To start a cluster, run: "minikube start"
Create a sample deployment and expose it on port 8080:
error: cluster "minikube" does not exist
error: cluster "minikube" does not exist
It may take a moment, but your deployment will soon show up when you run:
error: no server found for cluster "minikube"
The easiest way to access this service is to let minikube launch a web browser for you:
* Profile "minikube" not found. Run "minikube profile list" to view all profiles.
  To start a cluster, run: "minikube start"
Alternatively, use kubectl to forward the port:
error: no server found for cluster "minikube"
Tada! Your application is now available at http://localhost:7080/.
You should be able to see the request metadata in the application output. Try changing the path of the request and observe the changes. Similarly, you can do a POST request and observe the body show up in the output.
Halt the cluster:
* Profile "minikube" not found. Run "minikube profile list" to view all profiles.
  To start a cluster, run: "minikube start"

ansible is agentless running via ssh to manage machines
ansible uses yaml yet another markup language to manage hosts
ansible produces consistent configuration, the same each time
ansible inventory file clarifies the hosts on which to run
ansible roles allow grouping of tasks, handlers and variables which promote reusability and modularity
ansible playbooks are written in yaml and set tasks to be performed
ansible has master and hosts
ansible keeps lists of relevant hosts in the /etc/ansible/hosts file
ansible hosts specified in the inventory.ini file under the hosts flag

Description:
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applications— automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.

further learning with ansible
lets look at the ansible hosts file
cat /etc/ansible/hosts
# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups

# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers:

## green.example.com
## blue.example.com
## 192.168.100.1
## 192.168.100.10

# Ex 2: A collection of hosts belonging to the 'webservers' group:

## [webservers]
## alpha.example.org
## beta.example.org
## 192.168.1.100
## 192.168.1.110

# If you have multiple hosts following a pattern, you can specify
# them like this:

## www[001:006].example.com

# You can also use ranges for multiple hosts: 

## db-[99:101]-node.example.com

# Ex 3: A collection of database servers in the 'dbservers' group:

## [dbservers]
##
## db01.intranet.mydomain.net
## db02.intranet.mydomain.net
## 10.25.1.56
## 10.25.1.57


# Ex4: Multiple hosts arranged into groups such as 'Debian' and 'openSUSE':

## [Debian]
## alpha.example.org
## beta.example.org

## [openSUSE]
## green.example.com
## blue.example.com




now list ansible inventory
ansible-inventory -list
ERROR! No action selected, at least one of --host, --graph or --list needs to be specified.
usage: ansible-inventory [-h] [--version] [-v] [-i INVENTORY] [-l SUBSET]
                         [--vault-id VAULT_IDS]
                         [-J | --vault-password-file VAULT_PASSWORD_FILES]

                         [host|group]

Show Ansible inventory information, by default it uses the inventory script
JSON format

positional arguments:
  host|group

options:
  --export              When doing an --list, represent in a way that is
                        optimized for export,not as an accurate representation
                        of how Ansible has processed it
  --output OUTPUT_FILE  When doing --list, send the inventory to a file
                        instead of to the screen
  --playbook-dir BASEDIR
                        Since this tool does not use playbooks, use this as a
                        substitute playbook directory. This sets the relative
                        path for many features including roles/ group_vars/
                        etc.
  --toml                Use TOML format instead of default JSON, ignored for
                        --graph
  --vars                Add vars to graph display, ignored unless used with
                        --graph
  --vault-id VAULT_IDS  the vault identity to use. This argument may be
                        specified multiple times.
  --vault-password-file VAULT_PASSWORD_FILES, --vault-pass-file VAULT_PASSWORD_FILES
                        vault password file
  --version             show program's version number, config file location,
                        configured module search path, module location,
                        executable location and exit
  -J, --ask-vault-password, --ask-vault-pass
                        ask for vault password
  -e EXTRA_VARS, --extra-vars EXTRA_VARS
                        set additional variables as key=value or YAML/JSON, if
                        filename prepend with @. This argument may be
                        specified multiple times.
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INVENTORY, --inventory INVENTORY, --inventory-file INVENTORY
                        specify inventory host path or comma separated host
                        list. --inventory-file is deprecated. This argument
                        may be specified multiple times.
  -l SUBSET, --limit SUBSET
                        further limit selected hosts to an additional pattern
  -v, --verbose         Causes Ansible to print more debug messages. Adding
                        multiple -v will increase the verbosity, the builtin
                        plugins currently evaluate up to -vvvvvv. A reasonable
                        level to start is -vvv, connection debugging might
                        require -vvvv. This argument may be specified multiple
                        times.
  -y, --yaml            Use YAML format instead of default JSON, ignored for
                        --graph

Actions:
  One of following must be used on invocation, ONLY ONE!

  --graph               create inventory graph, if supplying pattern it must
                        be a valid group name. It will ignore limit
  --host HOST           Output specific host info, works as inventory script.
                        It will ignore limit
  --list                Output all hosts info, works as inventory script

github actions ... build test and deploy code
github actions ... can add labels when issue is created, for example
github actions run on linux windows or macos machines called runners
github actions ... workflow is triggered ... on event ...
... workflow contains jobs ... in sequence or in parallel
... each job runs in own runner vm or container
... each job has a number of steps ...
... each step runs a script or an action which is a reusable extension
event
... triggers workflow ... defined in yaml ...
... workflows in .github/workflows folder
... event ... workflow ...
... vm runner 1 runs job 1 ... steps ... either actions or scripts ...
... jobs .. can have dependencies if desired ...

run all my code on a commit, not just when i want to run it?
